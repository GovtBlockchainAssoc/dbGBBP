# GBBP-Pub

This is the server for the client-side React UI for the Government Business Blockchain Platform

The dist directory should be updated with the latest dist build from the GBBP repo before publishing

In the future, we should just dump the index.html file and the dist and build directorys on some static server (even GitHub)

(Yes, this really does tremendously speed up publishing and keeps a lot off the server)
